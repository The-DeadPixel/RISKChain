Project Description
-----
Risk is a game of world domination. Through the ups and downs of the game power is gained and lost at the peril of other players. Anyone who has played this classic board game know that it is cutthroat with triumph, failure, and sometimes emotional outbursts of rage, often resulting in boardflipping. This is where a blockchain can improve the board game world. Creating a Dapp (decentralized application) on a blockchain was a natural solution to these problems. Blockchains are immutable, so there is no flipping of boards, or cheating by fudging rolls or sneaking any extra troops in Argentina. Using react, web3 and Solidity this has become a reality with Risk-Chain.

The team project consists of creating a web platform game based on the classic board game of Risk.  The problem the team worked to find a solution for is to accurately track the state of a traditional board game built into a web app with a smart contract on the Ethereum blockchain to handle transacting with the state of the board.  The project relied heavily on React for the interface, while the logic for the game was built using Ethereum and Solidity to develop a Blockchain solution for tracking the state of the board, ensuring immutable game conditions. With all of these technologies converging together came the proposed solution dubbed “Risk-Chain”. Although the team decided to deviate from the original game rules to serve a web based variant, the solutions primary aims are consistent with the theme of the original game.
